    "\n",
    "_Hint_: In this test, you’re verifying the behavior of the `make_move` function under different scenarios. To do this, you’ll need to create specific board configurations (i.e., `initial_board`) to test whether the move works as expected.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.\tEmpty Board: A completely empty board where any valid move should succeed.\n",
    "2.\tOccupied Cell: A board where one cell is already taken. Try to make a move on that cell and check if it returns `False`.\n",
    "3.\tValid Move: A board where you attempt to place a move on a valid, empty cell.\n",
    "4.\tOut-of-Bounds Moves: Consider moves where row or col is outside the 3x3 grid (e.g., 3, 3 or -1, 0). These should raise an IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, start with a specific `initial_board`, then use the `make_move` function with a given `row`, `col`, and `player`. Based on the scenario, check if the move is successful (or not) and if the board is updated correctly.\n",
